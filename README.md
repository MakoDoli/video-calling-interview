# 🎥 CodeCam – Stare, Solve, Succeed

Welcome to **CodeCam** — where developers stare into the void (a.k.a. webcam), code under pressure, and sometimes even enjoy it.

This is a video-based mock interview platform built for those brave enough to combine eye contact and algorithmic thinking. Whether you're practicing solo, with a friend, or just rewatching your own facial expressions while debugging — CodeCam has you covered.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with modern tools, functional chaos, and minimal backend guilt:

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – because React needs structure sometimes
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – utility-first, naming-things-later
- **UI Library:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/) – clean components, beautiful defaults
- **Authentication:** [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) – quick, secure, and painless login
- **Video SDK:** [Stream](https://getstream.io/) – high-quality video calls that make Google Meet jealous
- **Code Editor:** [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) – the same one VS Code uses, because we’re fancy
- **Database / Logic Layer / Existential Crisis Generator:** [Convex](https://convex.dev/)

## 🎯 Features

What you can do in **CodeCam** (besides question your knowledge of binary trees):

- 🔐 **Secure login** via Clerk – no need to remember that 2008 password
- 📅 **Schedule interviews** – no need to sit in pajama
- 🎥 **Join video calls** – live, face-to-face awkward silence
- 🧠 **Choose a coding question** and a programming language – JavaScript or... you have another option?
- ✍️ **Write your solution in a built-in Monaco editor** – syntax highlighting and no console.log
- 📝 **Add comments & ratings** after the interview – because feedback is a gift (that sometimes stings)
- 🎛️ **Tweak your mic and camera** – or just blame them when your solution fails
- 🔴 **Record interviews** and rewatch them – for self-growth, or cringe, or both

> Sure, this *could* have been a real-time chat app...  
> But then again, this was supposed to be a **coding interview** – not a texting app with video.  
> So I gave you a code editor. You're welcome 😎

## 🛠️ Biggest challenge?  
Definitely **Convex**.

I mean… is it NoSQL? Is it backendless backend? APIs are functions like hooks ? I like hooks.. 🎣
